## 🤖 Offline Question Generator (RAG + Problem Adaptation)

Generate custom programming questions by adapting problems from the local DSA knowledge base (300+ problems from `data/DSA_Topics/`). **No internet, no LLMs, no GPUs required — everything runs locally inside Docker.**

### Setup RAG Database
```bash
# Ingest all 300+ DSA questions from the repository into ChromaDB (one-time)
docker compose exec app python manage.py rag_ingest
```

### Generate & Save a New Question
```bash
# Basic generation — generates question and saves it directly to the selected module
docker compose exec app python manage.py generate_question --topic "dynamic programming" --difficulty medium --module "Dynamic Programming"

# With custom instructions
docker compose exec app python manage.py generate_question \
  --topic "binary search" \
  --difficulty hard \
  --prompt "Focus on search on answer space problems" \
  --module "Binary Search"

# Preview only (dry run — does not save to database)
docker compose exec app python manage.py generate_question \
  --topic "graph traversal" \
  --difficulty easy \
  --dry-run

# Save output to file
docker compose exec app python manage.py generate_question \
  --topic "two pointers" \
  --difficulty easy \
  --output generated_question.json

# Save to specific module by ID
docker compose exec app python manage.py generate_question \
  --topic "hash maps" \
  --difficulty medium \
  --module-id 15
```

### Bulk Generate Questions
```bash
# From comma-separated topics
docker compose exec app python manage.py bulk_generate_questions \
  --topics "sorting,linked lists,trees" --difficulty easy --module-id 1

# From file (one topic per line)
docker compose exec app python manage.py bulk_generate_questions \
  --file /tmp/topics.txt --difficulty hard --module-id 1 --output /tmp/questions.json
```

### Available Topics
The RAG system covers 20 DSA topics with 15 problems each (300+ total):
- Array, String, Linked List, Stack, Queue
- Binary Trees, Binary Search, Heap/Priority Queue
- HashMap/Hashing, Graph (BFS/DFS)
- Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Greedy
- Two Pointers/Sliding Window, Bit Manipulation
- Sorting Algorithms, Matrix, Trie, Recursion
- Math/Number Theory

### How It Works (Completely Offline)

1. **RAG Retrieval**: Your topic is embedded using a local Sentence Transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and similar questions are retrieved from ChromaDB (300+ curated DSA problems from `data/DSA_Topics/`)

2. **Problem Adaptation**: Instead of an LLM, the system **adapts existing curated problems** to create new variants:
   - Selects the most relevant reference problems from the DSA database
   - Adjusts difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard) by modifying constraints and complexity
   - Generates appropriate starter code with function signatures
   - Creates 5-8 test cases including edge cases for harder difficulties
   - References the original problem in the description for transparency

3. **Validation & Save**: The adapted question (matching PRAXIS's JSON schema) is validated and saved directly to the specified module with all test cases

**Performance**: ~1-2 seconds per question (no LLM, no GPU, no internet required)

## 💡 Question-Grounded Progressive AI Tutor Hints (Max 3 Hints)

Students can unlock progressive pedagogical hints on demand with a simple click in the AI Tutor panel directly above the code editor. Hints are unlocked with intentional clicks rather than automatically consumed by submits, ensuring students retain full ownership of their problem-solving journey while submissions execute instantly in the sandbox without race conditions or throttling conflicts.

### 🧠 Question-Grounded Theory (Zero Code Policy)
Hints are **grounded strictly in the theoretical principles of the question** and adhere to a **strict zero-code policy**. The AI tutor inspects the specific question title, domain theory, mathematical definitions, and boundary constraints to generate academic conceptual guidance without providing syntax, code blocks, or solution snippets:
1. **🧠 Theoretical Foundations & Principles**: Core mathematical or computer science theory governing the problem (e.g., modular congruence, reflectional symmetry across a central axis, matrix Cartesian coordinates and row-major mapping, mathematical induction, Bellman's principle of optimality).
2. **⚙️ Algorithmic Paradigm & Complexity Theory**: Theoretical paradigms and structural models best suited for the problem (e.g., Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming optimal substructure, two-way boundary convergence, monotonicity) along with theoretical $O(...)$ asymptotic complexity bounds.
3. **🔍 Invariant Analysis & Conceptual Verification**: Theoretical invariant assertions and correctness conditions required throughout problem execution, identifying logical edge conditions and domain limits without code spoilers.

### 🎯 Progressive 3-Tier Hint Strategy

Hints are progressive and strictly capped at a **maximum of 3 unique hints per question**:

| Hint Level | Focus Area | Pedagogical Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Tier 1** | **Theoretical Foundations & Problem Principles** | Explains the underlying domain theory, mathematical definitions, and boundary conditions in plain conceptual English without code. |
| **Tier 2** | **Algorithmic Paradigm & Complexity Theory** | Explains the theoretical algorithmic paradigm, state transitions, and asymptotic complexity lower bounds without code. |
| **Tier 3** | **Invariant Analysis & Conceptual Verification** | Analyzes the theoretical invariants, correctness proofs, and edge-case boundary traps without code. |
| **Hints 4+** | **Capped at 3** | No further hints can be unlocked. All 3 previously unlocked hints remain accessible in the code editor and submission view. |

### 💡 On-Demand Click-to-Unlock & Cyber Violet Theme
- **Unlock With Clicks (Not Submits)**: The AI Tutor panel displays each locked hint with an interactive Cyber Violet action button (`[💡 Unlock Hint #N]`). Clicking the button triggers an immediate on-demand generation and reveals the hint with a smooth entrance animation (`hintRevealEntrance`), animated toast notifications (`💡 AI Tutor Hint #N Unlocked!`), and automatic badge updates (`1 of 3 Unlocked`).
- **Cyber Violet & Cyan Aesthetic**: Hints are styled with a sleek Cyber Violet (`#8b5cf6`), Indigo (`#6366f1`), and Cyan (`#06b6d4`) palette, featuring dedicated badge indicators, subtle glassmorphism borders, and clear typographic hierarchy.
- **Submissions Free of Side-Effects**: Submitting code runs sample and hidden tests in the sandbox independently without forcing hints or consuming the student's hint quota. Unsuccessful submissions simply display a polite note reminding students that hints can be unlocked above if needed.

### 🔒 Privacy & Pedagogical Safeguards
- **Zero External API Keys**: 100% offline and self-hosted. Student code never leaves the local campus network or server.
- **Strict Anti-Code Sanitization**: Comprehensive multi-stage sanitizers scrub raw code fences, code syntax, variable declarations, and programming keywords from LLM output, enforcing pure theoretical text.
- **Deterministic 11-Domain Theory Engine**: Powered by a local Ollama container running `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b`. If the model is offline or during high lab concurrency (up to 400 students), the built-in deterministic theory engine instantly produces structured theory hints covering Matrix, String, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Two Pointers/Sliding Window, Sorting/Searching, Number Theory, Linked Lists, Pointers, Structs, and Arrays with zero delay.
- **Instant Response & Zero Throttling**: Because hints are unlocked on-demand via clicks rather than bundled into submission background tasks, both submissions and hint generation remain responsive and completely immune to submit-spamming issues.

---

## 🛡️ User-Friendly Proctoring System

PRAXIS provides a smart, non-punitive proctoring system engineered specifically for computer science lab sessions and placement assessments:

- **In-Editor Clipboard Enabled**: Students are completely free to `copy`, `cut`, `paste`, and right-click within the Monaco code editor (`#editor`). Copying from external websites or outside the editor is restricted.
- **Graduated 3-Warning Notice System**: Instead of immediately locking the screen or showing jarring modal interruptions upon a brief window blur, the platform implements a polite 3-tier warning threshold:
  - **Warnings 1 & 2**: Non-blocking animated toast notifications (`🛡️ Proctoring Notice (1/3): Focus lost`) appear in the upper-right corner, and the proctoring badge updates dynamically (`Proctoring: 1/3 warnings`).
  - **Warning 3**: A polite proctoring modal appears prompting the student to return focus and resume coding.
- **Debounced Window & Tab Transitions**: Focus and blur events are debounced with a 400ms buffer, preventing false violation triggers caused by rapid tab switches, clicking browser menus, or clicking the run/submit buttons.
- **Non-Intrusive & Tab-Safe**: Intrusive infinite `debugger;` loops are eliminated, ensuring student browser tabs never lock up or freeze.
- **Polite Fullscreen Reminders**: Exiting fullscreen displays a friendly reminder toast rather than terminating the session.

## 📦 Docker Sandbox Execution

The custom Docker sandbox executes code submissions in fully isolated containers:

| Language | `language_id` | Toolchain | Strictness / Options |
|----------|---------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **C** | 50 | GCC (`gcc -std=c11`) | `-Wall -Wextra -Werror=return-type -Werror=main` |
| **C++** | 54 | GCC (`g++ -std=c++17`) | `-Wall -Wextra -Werror=return-type -Werror=main` |
| **Java** | 62 | OpenJDK 17 (`javac`/`java`) | Auto-detects public class name |
| **Python** | 71 | CPython 3 (`python3`) | Direct execution, syntax-checked |

### Sandbox Security Flags
- **No Network:** `--network none` — submissions cannot access external resources
- **Dropped Capabilities:** `--cap-drop ALL` — no special Linux capabilities
- **Resource Limits:** Memory (128MB), CPU (0.5 cores), PID (64 processes)
- **Ephemeral:** Fresh container per submission, cleaned up automatically
- **Base64 Encoding:** Source code and stdin are base64-encoded to prevent injection
- **tmpfs:** `/tmp` is an in-memory filesystem (50MB) for temporary files

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### 1. `DisallowedHost` or `Bad Request (400)`
- Ensure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `.env` includes `localhost,127.0.0.1` and your server's domain/IP.
- Restart app: `docker compose restart app`.

### 2. Database Connection Error
- Ensure container `elab-db` is running: `docker compose ps`.
- Check database logs: `docker compose logs elab-db`.
- Verify database credentials in `.env` match `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

### 3. Static Files Not Loading / Unstyled UI
- Run static collection:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec app python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
  docker compose restart nginx
  ```

### 4. Sandbox Execution Errors
- Ensure the sandbox image is built:
  ```bash
  docker build -t elab-sandbox -f sandbox/Dockerfile sandbox/
  ```
- Verify Docker socket is accessible: `ls -la /var/run/docker.sock`
- Check sandbox directory permissions: `chmod 777 sandbox_data`

### 5. Celery Worker Not Processing Tasks
- Check worker logs: `docker compose logs -f worker`
- Verify Redis is reachable: `docker compose exec elab-redis redis-cli ping`
- Restart worker: `docker compose restart worker`

### 6. Question Generator Issues
- Ensure RAG is ingested: `docker compose exec app python manage.py rag_ingest`
- Check RAG agent logs: `docker compose logs app`

### 7. Certificate PDF Generation Fails
- Ensure `weasyprint` dependencies are installed (included in Dockerfile)
- Check media directory permissions: `chmod -R 777 media/`

### 8. Local AI / Tutor Hints Troubleshooting
- **Ollama container status**: Verify Ollama is running: `docker compose ps ollama`.
- **Model verification**: Ensure `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` is downloaded:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec ollama ollama list
  ```
- **Fallback verification**: If Ollama is downloading, cold, or stopped, PRAXIS automatically falls back to the deterministic diagnostic engine. No student submissions fail or hang.
